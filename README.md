# Parallel Fast Fourier Transform using Cooley Tukey Algorithm


This project aims to implement Parallel Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) using Cooley-Tukey Algorithm in CUDA Programming. The CUDA implementation will be measured and compared to the C Language implementation of the same algorithm. The code will be implemented in Google Colab.
